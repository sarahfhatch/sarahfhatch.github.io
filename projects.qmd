I am an active contributor in Stephanie Jones' EASEL lab and Dana McCoy's SEED lab. I also am primary investigator on several of my own projects, with incredible mentors and peers providing critical feedback and partnership along the way. I am particularly drawn to "getting under the hood" of why people behave the ways they do when implementing or influencing children's education. 

# Independently-Led Research

## Parents' Politicized Views of Education in the US

- **Qualitative study** examining conservative parents' views of SEL (manuscript in preparation).
- **Conjoint survey** on Democrat and Republican SEL preferences.

## School Censorship Studies

- **Predicting school censorship behaviors** using a mix of classic and novel political science and social psychology measures.
- **Novel scales looking at parents' beliefs** surrounding "psychological fragility" and "conversational self-efficacy" using advanced psychometric approaches. 

# Collaborative Projects

## With Stephanie Jones (EASEL Lab)

- **Analyzing implementation data and impacts** from an RCT on SEL in after-school settings in Nebraska.
- **Analyzing implementation data** from the national rollout of a trauma-informed, locally adapted SEL curriculum in Ukraine.

## With Dana McCoy (SEED Lab)

- **Analyzing implementation of an AI-based parenting app in Peru**, which showed positive effects on children's development.
- **Examining mechanisms** connecting the app to these positive outcomes.
- **Investigating associations** between specific parenting behaviors and children's behavioral outcomes in this context.
