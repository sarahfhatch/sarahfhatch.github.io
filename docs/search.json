I am a third-year PhD student at Harvard Graduate School of Education.\nI study what we can do (programs, interventions) to help kids thrive, especially before they start to experience social, emotional, academic, or behavioral problems. I am trained by applied developmental psychologists with a focus on prevention and implementation science.\nCheck out my projects tab to see what Iâ€™m currently working on, or my CV for my most recent academic publications."
