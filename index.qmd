Hello! I am a third-year PhD student at Harvard Graduate School of Education. 

I study what we can do (programs, interventions) to help kids thrive, especially before they start to experience social, emotional, academic, or behavioral problems. I am trained by applied developmental psychologists with a focus on prevention and implementation science. 

Check out my projects tab to see what I'm currently working on, or my CV for my most recent academic publications.
