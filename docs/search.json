    "text": "Hello! I am a third-year PhD student at Harvard Graduate School of Education.\nI study what we can do (programs, interventions) to help kids thrive, especially before they start to experience social, emotional, academic, or behavioral problems. I am trained by applied developmental psychologists with a focus on prevention and implementation science.\nBefore my doctoral program, I worked as an education specialist at the University of Pennsylvania’s Implementation Science Center. I received a MSEd from the University of Pennsylvania’s Graduate School of Education and a BS in Sociology from Brigham Young University.\nCheck out my projects tab to see what I’m currently working on, or download my CV for my most recent academic publications."

I am also an active contributor in Stephanie Jones’ EASEL lab and Dana McCoy’s SEED lab. I am particularly drawn to “getting under the hood” of why people behave the ways they do when implementing or influencing children’s education, particularly education which supports children’s social and emotional learning (SEL)."
